-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=komi-can039t-communicate-vol13-chapter-177-goodbye-rei-chan>Komi Can't Communicate, Vol.13 Chapter 177: Goodbye, Rei-Chan<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#komi-can039t-communicate-vol13-chapter-177-goodbye-rei-chan>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://cdn.readkakegurui.com/file/mangaifenzi22/komi-can-t-communicate-vol-13-chapter-177-goodbye-rei-chan-6.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.9sb_CqwKZg0iqPV6y7tiJAHaKo&pid=15.1"' alt="Komi Can't Communicate, Vol.13 Chapter 177: Goodbye, Rei-Chan"><p><em>Source: komisanwamanga.com</em></p><blockquote><p>komi communicate manga rei goodbye chan vol chapter read cant.</p></blockquote><p>How to watch Anime: There are many different ways to watch anime including on television, DVD, or streaming services.
